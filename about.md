	<p class="intro">My name is Talpeanu Victor and  currently I am pursuing MCSA certification for Windows Server 2012 R2 and I hope to eventually become a System Administrator. I started this blog to provide and share valuable information about the 70-410, 70-411 and 70-412 Microsoft exam, hopefully you will find it useful.</p>
